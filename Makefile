# MAKEFILE - CS_3354_Team_2_Project
#
# This file provides convenient targets to:
#   - Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies (make setup)
#   - Run the FastAPI backend server (make run)
#   - Run unit tests with pytest (make test)
#   - Populate the Firestore database with sample data (make populate-db)
#   - Build and run Docker containers (make docker-up)
#   - Tear down Docker containers (make docker-down)
#   - Clean up __pycache__ folders (make clean)
#   - Run both backend and Flutter frontend concurrently (make run-all)
#
# The AI matching functionality is integrated in main.py and matching_ai.py.
# Ensure that your Firebase service account key (serviceAccountKey.json) is located
# in the code_1/ directory (this file is ignored by Git via .gitignore).
#
# RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:
#   - Run "make setup" to prepare your environment.
#   - Run "make populate-db" to load sample data into Firestore.
#   - Run "make run" to launch your FastAPI backend.
#   - Run "make test" to conduct unit tests.
#   - Run "make run-all" to launch both the backend at http://127.0.0.1:8001/match/101 
#     and the Flutter frontend at http://localhost:55242/.
